Overview:

This project implements a multithreaded clientâ€“server system in C for running graph algorithms.
Clients send requests over TCP sockets, and the server processes them concurrently using different threading models (Leader-Follower, Pipeline).

Features:

- MST (Minimum Spanning Tree)  
- Max Clique  
- Count Cliques  
- Hamiltonian Cycle  
- Euler Circuit
